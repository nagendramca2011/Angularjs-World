### Task 1

1. Create a controller named TabController.
2. An empty Controller isn't much use. Do you remember why we needed a Controller at all? That's right, we need to initialize the tab property. Go ahead and add that property now, setting it to 1
3. In order to set the current tab, we'll need a setTab method to use in our HTML. It should set the tab property of TabController to a value passed in.
4. We've got a setTab method. Now we need an isSet method that accepts a value and returns whether that value matches this.tab.
