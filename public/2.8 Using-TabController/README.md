## Tasks 

1. Attach the TabController to the ```<section>``` element with the .tab class. Don't forget to also add an alias.
2. Trigger the setTab method when a link inside a tab is clicked. Add this to each of the tab links. Pass in the number of the tab, in this case 1, 2 or 3.
3. Use the isSet method to show the corresponding tab. You'll need to add a directive to each of the <div> elements in .tab.
4. Add the active class to the correct <li> when each tab is clicked. You'll need to add a directive to each <li> in .nav.
5. Within the Description tab, output the product's description within the <blockquote> element.
